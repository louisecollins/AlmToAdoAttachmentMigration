# AlmToAdoAttachmentMigration
This project is created to facilitate the migration of ALM defect Attachments to Azure Dec Ops Work Item Attachments

ToDO: Reporting hasn't been done

What to Watch out For!
If your Defect Attachment name has '#' in the title, this will cause a failure - try to avoid this

Dependencies - Code expects an xlsx file to contain ALM Defect Id and ALM Defect Attachment Name
(you can get this by running the following query from ALM)...


Please Update: your instance of QC and Azure into the respective variables.
